Assignment files for the second homework for ML in computational finance. This assignment was based on regression and its generalizations; GLM and sparsity constraints and
continues on from the first homework. We use the same real life data set as in the first homework and try to predict whether a particular
stock will go up or down. We use different regularizations to our logistic regression objective and compare their performance.
