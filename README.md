# Machine Learning in Computational Finance

This is a collection of assignments for a course on Machine Learning in Computational Finance that I attended. The course gave a survey of machine learning methods in the context of computational finance with the following units:

1. Regression and its generalizations (GLM, sparsity, constraints)

2.  Decomposition methods (SVD, RPCA, NMF)

3.  Time series models

4.  Unsupervised/nonparametric methods (e.g.  clustering)

The course was a mix of optimization techniques, statistical modeling, and computational finance applications.  The assigments covered modeling, theory and computation. I used Python and Julia to do the coding part of the assignments.
