Assignment files for the first homework for ML in computational finance. This assignment was based on regression 
and its generalizations; GLM and sparsity constraints. (An interesting question in this assignment was to use a modified 
logistic regression technique to predict whether a stock will go up or down with real data.) See the accompanying Jupyter notebook
to see how the method performed on test data!
